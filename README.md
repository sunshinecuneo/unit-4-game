The Crystal Collector Game is an interactive game. You will be given a random
target number at the start of the game.

There are four crystals below. By clicking on a crystal you will add a
specific amount of points to your total score.

You will win the game by matching your total score to the random target number;
you lose the game if your total score goes above the random number.
The value of each crystal is hidden from you until you click on it.
Each time the game starts over, the game will change the values of
each crystal as well as the random target number.



The Crystal Collector Game was fun to create but also challenging and frustrating!
I do feel like I learned a lot but don't feel like I could be doing this on my own
(maybe that's still normal at this stage of the game; maybe not!). Either way that 
part is frustrating me!

I have a hard time knowing where to start and often get stuck and don't know how to
get unstuck. Thanks to my tutor for help, Sarah for a few valuable minutes of her
lunch time one day and as always Sangeetha for her dilignece in nudging me the right
direction and helping me figure things out. Soory I frustrate you Sangeetha!

On to the next assignment! UGH!! :)
